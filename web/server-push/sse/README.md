# Server-Sent Events

Server-Sent Events (SSE) is a technology that enables servers to send updates to the client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. It is particularly useful for applications that require real-time data flow from the server to the client, such as live blogs, news feeds, or real-time monitoring dashboards. SSE is part of the HTML5 standard and offers a more efficient and simpler alternative to techniques like long polling.

## How Server-Sent Events Work

1. __Connection Establishment__: The client initiates the SSE connection by making an HTTP request to the server. This is a standard HTTP request, but it includes an "Accept" header set to "text/event-stream", indicating that the client is ready to receive streaming data.

2. __Data Streaming__: Once the connection is established, the server can begin sending data to the client in a stream. Each piece of data is sent as an "event". These events are formatted as plain text and can contain multiple fields:

  * `data`: Contains the actual data payload.
  * `id`: An optional unique identifier for that event.
  * `event`: An optional name for the event type, which can be used by the client to trigger different actions based on the event type.
  * `retry`: An optional interval in milliseconds that the client should wait before attempting to reconnect if the connection is lost.

3. __Maintaining the Connection__: If the connection is closed by the client or due to some error, the client will automatically try to re-establish the connection using the same endpoint. If the server provided an `id` with the last event, the client can send this back to the server in a `Last-Event-ID` header to allow the server to resume from the last event sent.

## Features and Benefits

* __Built-in Browser Support__: Most modern browsers support SSE natively, which simplifies the implementation as there is no need for any additional libraries or plugins.

* __Automatic Reconnection__: The browser automatically handles reconnections in case of a connection drop, using the last event ID to ensure continuity of the data stream.

* __Reduced Complexity__: Unlike WebSockets, SSE is a simpler protocol to implement, especially when only unidirectional communication (server to client) is required.

* __Efficiency__: SSE connections can remain open indefinitely, and the server can send messages at will without the overhead of re-establishing connections or the overhead of HTTP headers with each message.

## Limitations

* __Unidirectional__: SSE only supports data flow from server to client. If bidirectional communication is needed, other technologies like WebSockets might be more appropriate.

* __Proxy and Firewall Issues__: Some network proxies and firewalls are not configured to handle long-lived HTTP connections well, which can lead to connections being dropped unexpectedly. _Not relevant for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3_.

## Typical Use Cases

* __Live Notifications__: SSE is ideal for applications that need to push updates to the client, such as notifying users of new emails or social media posts.

* __Real-time Data Feeds__: Applications that display real-time information like stock tickers, sports scores, or live statistics can use SSE to stream updates to the client as soon as they become available.

* __Monitoring Dashboards__: SSE can be used to push updates to a dashboard that monitors the status of various systems or processes in real-time.

In summary, Server-Sent Events provide a straightforward method for web servers to communicate with clients over HTTP in a way that is designed to be efficient, easy to use, and supported by the web platform. Itâ€™s particularly good for scenarios requiring frequent updates from the server to the client in environments where complex setups like WebSockets may not be necessary or ideal.

## Example

### Message

```
id: 67890
event: messageUpdate
data: First line of the message.
data: Second line of the message.
retry: 7000
```

### Client

To handle this on the client side using JavaScript, you would typically use an `EventSource` interface which is designed specifically for handling SSE. Here is an example of how you might set up an event listener for the "cryptoDepositCreated" event type:

```javascript
var eventSource = new EventSource('https://example.com/events');
eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('New message:', event.data);
};

eventSource.addEventListener('update', function(event) {
  console.log('Received an event:', event.data);
  console.log('Event ID:', event.lastEventId);
});

eventSource.onerror = function(event) {
  console.error('Error occurred:', event);
};
```

In this setup:

* `eventSource.onmessage` is used to handle generic messages that don't specify an event type.
* `eventSource.addEventListener('update', ...)` is used to handle messages of type "update".
* Each handler receives an event object that contains the data and `lastEventId` from the SSE message, and potentially other attributes like the event type.

### Server using ASP.NET Core

`SseService.cs`:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using System.Threading.Channels;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

public class SseService
{
    private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, Channel<string>> _clients = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, Channel<string>>();

    public ChannelReader<string> AddClient(string clientId)
    {
        var channel = Channel.CreateUnbounded<string>();
        _clients.TryAdd(clientId, channel);
        return channel;
    }

    public void RemoveClient(string clientId)
    {
        if (_clients.TryRemove(clientId, out var channel))
        {
            channel.Writer.Complete();
        }
    }

    public async Task SendMessageAsync(string clientId, string message)
    {
        if (_clients.TryGetValue(clientId, out var channel))
        {
            await channel.Writer.WriteAsync(message);
        }
    }
}
```

`SseController.cs`:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class SseController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly SseService _sseService;

    public SSEController(SseService sseService)
    {
        _sseService = sseService;
    }

    [HttpGet("connect/{clientId}")]
    public async Task Connect(string clientId)
    {
        Response.ContentType = "text/event-stream";

        var messageChannel = _sseService.AddClient(clientId);

        var cancellationToken = HttpContext.RequestAborted;

        try
        {
            await foreach (var message in messageChannel.ReadAllAsync(cancellationToken))
            {
                await Response.WriteAsync($"event: cryptoDepositCreated\n\n");
                await Response.WriteAsync($"data: {message}\n\n");
                await Response.Body.FlushAsync();
            }
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            // Catch cancellation due to client disconnecting
        }
        finally
        {
            _sseService.RemoveClient(clientId);
        }
    }
}
```
